# Introduction

This is a design description for assignment 5.

About the UML class diagram, data classes are located at the top of the diagram, which consist of `Job`, `User`, and `ComparisonSettings`. And, control classes are located at bottom of the diagram, which consist of `MainActivity`, `EnterOrEditCurrentJob`, `EnterJobOffer`, `AdjustComparisonSettings`, `RankJob` and `CompareJob`. How these classes are designed will be described in the Requirements section, where each requirement is explained one by one.

# Requirements

## Requirement 1
> When the app is started, the user is presented with the main menu, which allows the user to (1) enter or edit current job details, (2) enter job offers, (3) adjust the comparison settings, or (4) compare job offers (disabled if no job offers were entered yet).

The entry point of this app is controlled by a class called `MainActivity`. Initialization of this class include initialization of an object of `User` class, which represents the current user with data stored in this class. The `MainActivity::draw()` method in the class will create the GUI, which include four buttons to trigger different actions.

1. enter or edit current job details: `EnterOrEditCurrentJob` class will be instantiated, and the control of screen will be transited to `EnterOrEditCurrentJob`.
2. enter job offers: `EnterJobOffer` class will be instantiated, and the control of screen will be transited to `EnterJobOffer`.
3. adjust the comparison settings: `AdjustComparisonSettings` class will be instantiated, and the control of screen will be transited to `AdjustCompaisonSettings`.
4. compare job offers: This button will be disabled when `MainActivity::draw()` draws the GUI if there is no job offer stored in `User` object. When the button is enabled, `RankJob` class will be instantiated, and the control of screen will be transited to `RankJob`.

## Requirement 2
> When choosing to enter current job details, a user will: a. Be shown a user interface to enter (if it is the first time) or edit all of the details of their current job

With the screen controlled by object `EnterOrEditCurrentJob`, the `EnterOrEditCurrentJob::draw()` will create a GUI for the user to enter or modify the current job information, which is stored in `User::currentJob`.
A user can only have one current job, which is represented in the UML class diagram as a `User` has a `CurrentJob`. Depending on if `User::currentJob` is empty, the `EnterOrEditCurrentJob::draw()` will decide whether to show information on saved current job.

The `Job` class has attributes to store all the necessary information. Since `User::currentJob` is a class of `Job`, all the job details can be stored in `User` object through set methods in `Job` class.

>b. Be able to either save the job details or cancel and exit without saving, returning in both cases to the main menu.

Two buttons are provided in the GUI: one calls `EnterOrEditCurrentJob::saveChange()` to save the edited information; another calls `EnterOrEditCurrentJob::cancelChange()` to discard the edited information. Upon completion of either of the methods, control of screen will be transited back to `MainActivity` through `EnterOrEditCurrentJob::returnToMain()`.

## Requirement 3
> When choosing to enter job offers, a user will: a. Be shown a user interface to enter all of the details of the offer, which are the same ones listed above for the current job.

With the screen controlled by object `EnterJobOffer`, the `EnterJobOffer::draw()` will create a GUI for the user to enter all the details of the offer, which will be stored in `User::jobOffers`. In the UML class diagram, this relationship is represented as a `User` has a list of `JobOffer`. Since `JobOffer` is a `Job`, all the job details can be saved in the `User` object.

> b. Be able to either save the job offer details or cancel.
>
> c. Be able to (1) enter another offer, (2) return to the main menu, or (3) compare the offer (if they saved it) with the current job details (if present).

The requirement b is implemented with c as following:

(1) is implemented as a button, which triggers either `EnterJobOffer::saveChange()` or `EnterJobOffer::cancelChange()` according to the user's choice on the pop-up. `EnterJobOffer::saveChange()` saves the edited information to a new `JobOffer`, and this new `JobOffer` will be added to the list `User::jobOffers`. `EnterJobOffer::cancelChange()` discards the changes and the `User` object will not be modified. After the methods complete, an action of clearing all the information on the screen will be triggered in order to enter another offer through `EnterJobOffer::clearCurrentJob`.

(2) is implemented as another button, which triggers either `EnterJobOffer::saveChange()` or `EnterJobOffer::cancelChange()` according to the user's choice on the pop-up. An action of returning to main screen will be triggered upon completion of the methods through `EnterJobOffer::returnToMain()`.

(3) is implemented as another button, which can only be enabled if `User::currentJob` is not empty. A pop-up will ask the user to save the change. If a user agrees to save the change, `EnterJobOffer::saveChange()` will be triggered and the control of screen will be transited to `CompareJobOffer` by calling `EnterJobOffer::compareOfferWithCurrent()`, which is represented as a single-headed arrow in the diagram. Otherwise, the screen returns to the job offer enter screen with nothing changed.

## Requirement 4

> When adjusting the comparison settings, the user can assign integer weights
>
> If no weights are assigned, all factors are considered equal.

With the screen controlled by `AdjustComparisonSettings`, the `AdjustComparisonSettings::draw()` will create a GUI for the user to adjust the weights, which are held in `User::ComparisonSettings`. `User::ComparisonSettings` is an attribute of `User`, which means the relationship is represented as a `User` has a `ComparisonSettings`. When `User::ComparisonSettings` is initialized, all the weights are set to 1 which is shown in `ComparisonSettings` class. The weights can be reset to 1, equal for all the factors, by calling `ComparisonSettings::resetComparisonSettings()`. If the user triggers save the weights by pressing the save button, `ComparisonSettings::setComparisonSettings()` is called to save the weights into `User::ComparisonSettings`.

## Requirement 5
> When choosing to compare job offers, a user will: a. Be shown a list of job offers, displayed as Title and Company, ranked from best to worst (see below for details), and including the current job (if present), clearly indicated.

When the screen is controlled by `RankJob`, all the jobs including the current job and job offers will be ranked by calling `RankJob::rankJobs()` in `RankJob::draw()`. It returns an ordered list of jobs, and GUI will display the jobs according to this list.

> b. Select two jobs to compare and trigger the comparison.

In GUI, two jobs can be selected, though not shown in the diagram. With a button is pressed, comparison is triggered by calling `RankJob::compareJobs()`. Upon the calling, the control of screen is transited to `CompareJob`.

> c. Be shown a table comparing the two jobs, displaying, for each job

When the screen is controlled by `CompareJob`, a table comapring the two jobs is drawn by `CompareJob::draw()` with information stored in `User::jobOffers` and `User::currentJob` if not empty.

> d. Be offered to perform another comparison or go back to the main menu.

By pressing a button in the GUI, another comparison can be conducted by calling `CompareJob::returnToRankJobOffer()` to transit the screen to `RankJob`. Or, another button to go back to the main menu which can be triggered by `CompareJob::returnToMain()`.

## Requirement 6

> When ranking jobs, a jobâ€™s score is computed as the weighted sum of

Inside `RankJob::rankJobs()`, the `RankJob::computeWeightedSum()` is called to compute a job's score, supplied with job details and the user's customized weight. It is this function that uses the formula and return a score.

## Requirement 7

> The user interface must be intuitive and responsive.

This requirement cannot be represented in the class diagram, since it is handled in GUI implementation.

## Requirement 8

> For simplicity, you may assume there is a single system running the app (no communication or saving between devices is necessary).

The class diagram was created upon this requirement, where a single system runs the app. Interaction between the classes assumed everything can be communicated without extra help.
